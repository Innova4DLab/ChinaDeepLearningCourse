    "* Regression is done using different loss functions from classification; Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a commonly used loss function for regression.\n",
    "* Similarly, evaluation metrics to be used for regression differ from those used for classification; naturally the concept of \"accuracy\" does not apply for regression. A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "* When features in the input data have values in different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently as a preprocessing step.\n",
    "* When there is little data available, using K-Fold validation is a great way to reliably evaluate a model.\n",
    "* When little training data is available, it is preferable to use a small network with very few hidden layers (typically only one or two), in order to avoid severe overfitting.\n"
