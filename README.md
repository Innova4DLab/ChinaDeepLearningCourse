# ChinaDeepLearningCourse

In this short course are described the use of Keras and Tensorflow packages for manipulating neural networks in the context of machine learning. In specific, the following notebooks are shown:

1. Classical machine learning example using different classifiers over a social media dataset.
2. Neural network example using the Keras package over a classification problem using the Mnist dataset.
3. Neural network example using the Keras package over a regression example using the Boston House Prices dataset.
4. Neural network example using the Tensorflow package over a classification problem using the Mnist dataset.
